# Legal Information


## Hosting

This _Hosting_ section **only** applies to the site [**cheats.rs**](https://cheats.rs), not if you reached this work by other means.

### Operator

<!-- NOTICE - THIS SECTION IS NOT COVERED BY CC- OR ANY OTHER LICENSE -->

Ralf Biedert <sup><a href="mailto:webmaster@cheats.rs">ðŸ“§</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://xr.io">ðŸ”—</a></sup>

<!-- END NOTICE -->


### Privacy, GDPR

- This site is **dispatched via Cloudflare's CDN** and most users should only interact with their edge servers. If you provide _Feedback_ (see below) you may additionally connect to AWS.
- The **Edit & Run** feature of the "Hello, Rust" section embeds the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/). All code entered there is sent to and processed on their servers.
- We are generally **not aware of any user tracking** and only aggregate statistics (e.g., users by country) are retained by our hosting provider. **Access logs** are usually disabled, but might be enabled along with other measures to diagnose and mitigate hosting issues.
- The browser's **local storage** may be necessary to store settings between sessions (e.g., dark mode, ligatures, banner visibility), if you requested such a setting to take effect. This information never leaves your machine.
- Supporting developer assets and metadata are usually **hosted on Github** so their privacy and tracking legalese applies.


### Terms of Service

- **Humans** (you!) may, with the help of a browser or similar, freely access any information on this site in accordance with the rest of these rules. You are in particular free to submit _organic feedback_ (i.e., ad-hoc, human-created) in whatever language, or with whatever words you desire, and any such feedback is fair use.

- **Bots** and other animated rocks may read data for reasonable purposes occasionally. Bots are _never_ allowed to post or invoke APIs, and any such use is considered abuse.

- The **Feedback Buttons** allow you to send _sentiments_ and text.


    We will store your submission, including context (e.g., section headers or user agents for site debugging). No identifiable information is preserved.

    Should we find identifiable information was submitted by you by accident then we will attempt to remove it on a best-effort basis. However, no guarantees are given such monitoring will take place, or is successful.

    Storage happens in the European Union.

    You agree to give us the right to use your feedback for improvements to this site, process it with 3rd party services (e.g., Google Translate), and to share and publish it (e.g., in Github tickets).

    Access to raw data is generally available to the operators of this site and their designated persons (and theoretically our hosting provider, and 3rd parties that enforce access via legal means, e.g., the police).
